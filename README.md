# VAE-GAN-Handshape-Generation
VAE-GAN Adversarial Learning for Latent Space Handshape Generation

Project overview:

(1)Development of Resnetblock based encoder and generator using Kl loss and reconstruction loss to improve the quality of generated images in generative model 

(2)Development of binary cross entropy adversarial loss based discriminator and dense autoencoder architecture

(3)Mean square error is used as a model validation metric and the model is able to generate high quality hand images in 100 epochs
